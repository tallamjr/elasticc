# `elasticc` 🔭

DESC's Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge

## TODO 📝

1. Write `train.py` file for training on recently created processed dataset
2. Log steps to create `X_train.npy` etc.
3. Make notebook for testing pipeline and making plots. Create this after
   processing data and making subset of data. Or pull down 1 day of data for
   testing purposes.
